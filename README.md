Feature:
Helps land surveyors locate unknown landmarks.

How to Use:

1. Start the Land Surveyor job.
2. Choose the landmark you want to find.
3. Enter the distance to the landmark and click Record Position.
4. Move at least 30m and repeat step 3 until you have 3 recordings.
5. A waypoint will appear at the estimated landmark location. Since two possible locations exist, use Toggle Waypoint to switch between them.
6. To find a new landmark, click Reset and repeat the process.

   
Note:
If an error occurs (e.g., due to poor positioning), click Reset and try recording from more widely spaced locations.
